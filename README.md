# The Drawbacks of Using BMI 
The BMI formula is so simple, it's easy to use by just about everyone. However, it's that simplicity that makes it inaccurate because it only takes into account your height and weight. Whether you're overweight or not requires much more information than just your height and weight.

Here are all the things that this BMI formula can get wrong:

How Much Muscle You Have: The more you have the higher your BMI will be, even though you may be healthy
Frame Size: A person with a big frame will have a higher BMI, although he or she may still be healthy
Gender: At the same BMI, women will usually have more body fat than men
Age: At the same BMI, an older person will usually have more fat than younger adults
If You're an Athlete: At the same BMI, athletes will usually have less body fat than people who aren't athletes.
If you're very muscular, pregnant, or have a large frame, your BMI calculation may show you as overweight or obese, even when you're not.

How your body fat is distributed is also important for predicting your risk of heart disease, obesity-related illnesses, and death. It's a good idea to use a variety of tools to determine how healthy your weight and body fat is including waist-to-hip ratio and/or your body fat percentage.
